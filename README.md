Five-Multiplayer is a multiplayer modification for the game called "Grand Theft Auto V" created by Rockstar Games and published by Take-Two Interactive Software.
Five Multiplayer is in no way affiliated with Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive. The 'Grand Theft Auto' and the 'Grand Theft Auto' logos are trademarks of Take-Two Interactive Software. 

This project uses RakNet, OpenVHook and parts of m0d-s0beit and CitizenMP - They are included in the repository and the files should have their credits on the top. If not, let us know and we'll add it!

# Compiling

In order to compile the mod, it is recommended to use *Visual Studio 2015* or [*Visual Studio CE (Community Edition) 2015*](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx) if possible. Otherwise the mod may not work / may crash during the loading screen.
As of now, the mod can be compiled in *debug mode x64* and *release mode x64*. The main solution file can be found in *FiveMP\FiveMP_Launcher (FiveMP_Launcher.sln)*. FiveMP does not support any 32 bit builds due to the fact that Grand Theft Auto V is a 64 bit game!

# Binaries

After compiling the mod, Release binaries can be found in FiveMP\bin\Release and Debug binaries in FiveMP\bin\Debug.
Double clicking *FiveMP.exe* should start the mod and start a new game. Binaries need to be in your *Grand Theft Auto V* folder (client files) and they should all be within the same directory for the mod to work, this is primarily due to the new .INI file addition which you can find in a released build. Except for the server files, you can place these anywhere as long as their own files are in the same directory.
