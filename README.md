# Compiling

In order to compile the mod, it is recommended to use *Visual Studio 2015* or [*Visual Studio CE (Community Edition) 2015*](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx) if possible. Otherwise the mod may not work / may crash during the loading screen.
As of now, the mod can be compiled in *debug mode x64* and *release mode x64*. The main solution file can be found in *FiveMP\FiveMP_Launcher (FiveMP_Launcher.sln)*.

# Binaries

After compiling the mod, 64 bit Release binaries can be found in FiveMP\bin\Release and 64 bit Debug binaries in FiveMP\bin\Debug.
Double clicking *FiveMP.exe* should start the mod and start a new game. Binaries don't need to be in any specific location but they should all be within the same directory for the mod to work. Except for the server files.
